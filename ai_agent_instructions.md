## CLAUDE 4 specific misbehavings

- Claude 4 makes huge amount of test and doc files all over the places, and only occasionally removes them after task has been accomplished.
- Claude 4 uses timeout on bash command which is not available in macos
- Claude 4 leaves old code as fallbacks and legacy, even the library is in the development state. this piles up to huge files
- Claude 4 introduces fixes and patches to the code that it has created just few moments ago and which is not approved as tested and published feature, so it confuces development state and production ready maintainance code changes
- Claude 4 uses a lot of superlative and hype words which are naive in the code and documentation
- Claude 4 does not vaivaudu to factirize and modulirize code for smaller maintanable files, but create monith files which it cannot handle at the end
-
