- ✅ Independent SVCS database initialization across team members
- ✅ Git hooks automatically installed and functional

#### 2. Feature Development Workflow
- ✅ Feature branch creation and semantic tracking
- ✅ Real-time code analysis during commits
- ✅ Detection of multiple semantic event types:
  - `dependency_added` (re, typing modules)
  - `node_added` (new functions: validate_email, sanitize_string, calculate_statistics)
  - `node_logic_changed` (function modifications)
  - `function_modified` (enhanced processing)

#### 3. Concurrent Development & Collaboration
- ✅ Parallel development on main and feature branches
- ✅ Clean merge operations preserving semantic data
- ✅ Conflict resolution without data corruption
- ✅ Cross-repository semantic consistency

#### 4. Advanced Semantic Features
- ✅ Comprehensive search and filtering capabilities
- ✅ Function/class evolution tracking
- ✅ Pattern-based semantic analysis
- ✅ Author and branch-aware queries

## 🚀 ENHANCED FEATURES IMPLEMENTED

### New Auto Git Initialization
```bash
# For new projects
svcs init --git-init    # Auto-creates git repo + SVCS

- ✅ User-friendly guidance for all scenarios

### Production-Ready CLI Commands
```bash
svcs init [--git-init]           # Project setup
svcs status                      # Repository status
svcs events --limit N            # Recent semantic events
svcs search --pattern-type X     # Advanced search
svcs evolution "func:name"       # Function evolution tracking
```
